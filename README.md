This repository provides a **single-GPIS Isaac Lab testbed** for our paper  
**“Autonomous Exploration for Shape Reconstruction and Measurement via Informative Contact-Guided Planning (AESRM)”**.


🔗 **Project Page:**  [https://aesrm.github.io](https://aesrm.github.io)


It implements a simplified version of the AMMH framework in simulation, focusing on **tactile exploration** and **surface reconstruction** with a **simple contact points**, and is mainly intended for testing and debugging the GPIS-based exploration pipeline.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FerryRain/Hand_Exlporation.git
   cd Hand_Exploration
   ```

2. **Create the Conda environment**:

   Create a new environment using the provided `environment.yaml`:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   conda activate hand_exploration
   ```

3. **Install Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab dependencies manually**:

   - Follow the official installation guides:

     - [Isaac Sim Installation Guide](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install-workstation.html)
     - [Isaac Lab Setup Instructions](https://isaac-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html)

   - Typically, you need to:
     - Download and install **Isaac Sim**.
     - Set up environment variables (e.g., `source setup_env.sh` inside Isaac Sim folder).
     - Install **Isaac Lab** Python packages inside your environment:

       ```bash
       cd /path/to/isaaclab
       pip install -e .
       ```
    ⚠️ **Note:**  
    Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab require specific versions of CUDA, GPU drivers, and system dependencies.  
    Make sure your machine meets their requirements.
## Main Components

   conda activate hand_exploration
   ```

   ```bash
   cd Env
   python Exploration_env_stage{x}.py
   ```

## Experiment Stages Overview

The project progresses through **nine stages** of tactile exploration and surface reconstruction:

1. **Stage 1: Teleportation + Contact**

   * The hand is directly teleported to object surface to collect initial contact points.

2. **Stage 2: `move_to` + Uncertainty**

   * The hand moves toward regions of higher surface uncertainty using basic motion primitives.

3. **Stage 3: Surface Constraint + Smoothness**

   * Hand motion is constrained on the object surface.
   * Guided by both uncertainty gradient and contact smoothness (possibly using δ constraints).

4. **Stage 4: Global Point Sampling as AS Input**

   * Actively samples next exploration targets from global surface uncertainty map.

5. **Stage 5: Position Control Version**

   * Replaces high-level `move_to` with low-level position control for trajectory execution.

6. **Stage 6: Continuous PID Control**

   * Employs PID-based continuous control to smoothly follow desired paths along surface.

7. **Stage 7: New GPIS Initialization Function**

   * Improves initialization of the GPIS model with different spatial priors (e.g. spherical or conic).

8. **Stage 8: Hybrid Force-Position Control**

   * Combines force feedback with position control to ensure compliant, stable contact.
